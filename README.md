#React Components
This is a collection of every reusable React component used in [Buildo](http://buildo.io/).

Its purpose is to give access to all these components through a single npm dependency so to improve the development experience and make eventual changes of library easier, faster and centralized.

###Install
the npm package is yet to be defined :)

###Usage
Each component is stored inside its own folder (useful for small bundles).
The import works as documented on the third party library:
```
import {DatePickerInput} from 'package-name-to-define/datepicker';
import CookieBanner from 'package-name-to-define/cookie-banner';
```
